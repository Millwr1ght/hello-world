# hello-world
gotta start with the basics, eh?

I am nateo, also commonly known by some variation of Nate, Millwright, infin8j and/or "that guy."
I am somewhere between an engineer, a developer, and a storywriter. I also bake, make and create.
I'm more from Detroit than from anywhere else, but I will still occasionally identify as a Canadian.

If anything, this is my own personal "please hold while I figure this out" repository. So please hold while I...

figure this out.
