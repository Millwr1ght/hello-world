# hello-world
gotta start with the basics, eh?

I am nateo, I am somewhere between an engineer, a developer, and a storywriter.
I'm more from Detroit than from anywhere else, but I will still occasionally identify as a Canadian.

I work for BYU's Office of Information Technology as a Student Engineer on the BYU OIT Monitoring Team.
