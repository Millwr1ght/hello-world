# hello-world
gotta start with the basics, eh?

I am Millwr1ght, also commonly known by some variation of infinate, Millwr1ght, infin8, etc.
I am somewhere between an engineer, a developer, and a storywriter. I also bake, make and create.
I'm more from Detroit than from anywhere else.

My goal with this project is to figure out how to say "Hello!" in as many languages as I can.

This is my "please hold while I figure this out" project. So please hold while I...

figure this out.
