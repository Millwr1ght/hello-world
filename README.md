# hello-world
gotta start with the basics, eh?

I am Nathan, also commonly known by some variation of Nate, Nateo, Millwr1ght, infin8j, etc.
I am somewhere between an engineer, a developer, and a storywriter. I also bake, make and create.
I'm more from Detroit than from anywhere else, but I will occasionally identify as a Vancouverite.

This is my own personal "please hold while I figure this out" project. So please hold while I...

figure this out.
